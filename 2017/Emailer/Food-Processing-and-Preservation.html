        <font face="Cambria, Hoefler Text, Liberation Serif, Times, Times New Roman, serif">This short course deals with various aspects associated with food processing and preservation. The first segment will begin 
        with an overview of ingredients used in different foods and post-harvest handling of raw materials. This will be followed by the 
        various methods to preserve foods and the importance of water activity and pH in the choice of the chosen method. A discussion on 
        the beneficial components within various foods and the techniques to process various categories of foods will follow. Some of the 
        important design considerations associated with food processing facilities will then be discussed. The second segment of the 
        course will focus on the different types of heating equipment and processes. Process such as blanching, freezing, baking, roasting, 
        frying, drying, extrusion, pasteurization, canning, hot-fill, aseptic processing, and non-thermal technologies will be discussed. The 
        final segment will begin with an overview of the kinetics associated with microorganisms, enzymes, and nutrients in foods. This will 
        be followed by the physico-chemical changes that take place within foods during processing and the quality &amp; safety aspects 
        associated with different foods. Achieving the desired shelf life with various types of packages will then be discussed. The course 
      will end with a discussion on how thermal processes are established and validated as per food laws and regulations.</font></td>

Sciencesat NC State University, USA. After completing his Ph.D. at PennState in 1996 and a one year post-doctoral fellowship, he joined NC State in 1997. Since
then, he has been involved with the Center for Advanced Processing and Packaging Studies (CAPPS) and is currently serving as the site director of CAPPS at NC
State. Dr. Sandeep’s research interests are focused around thermal processing of foods. His teaching interests and responsibilities include “Food Engineering”,
“Thermal Processing of Foods”, and “Food Packaging”. He has also served as an instructor for short courses for companies & FDA and an invited speaker at
various events. He has served as a consultant on Thermal Processing to several companies (for pasteurization, canning, hot-fill, and aseptic processing of acid
and low-acid fluid and particulate products – from process development to process validation to meet FDA & USDA regulations) and serves as a member of the
Advisory Board to the Southeast Dairy Foods Research Center (SDFRC). He has also served on review boards and panels (USDA, Institute of Medicine for NASA) to
guide organizations. On request, he also coordinates short courses or training programs tailored to meet the specific needs of FDA and various companies.</font></td>
